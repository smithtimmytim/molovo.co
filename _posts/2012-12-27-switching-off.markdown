### Confessions of a workaholic

I work too much. Always have, always will. I'm always either at my desk at home or my desk at work. The only exceptions are eating and sleeping, neither of which I do often enough. Even when traveling between home and the office I'm tied to my phone, replying to emails, tweets and Facebook posts, all in the name of 'business'.

I spend far too little time with my family, and even when I do, there is always a phone, tablet or laptop within arm's reach so that I can "just take a quick look at something". Any semblance of a social life went out the window years ago.

I've always used the hamster time recording software for recording my billable hours, but recently I started recording my unbillable hours too; the time I spend emailing, writing blog posts, working on my own projects or contributing to shared open source projects. I did this so that I could see just how much work I am actually doing. In the three weeks before Christmas, I averaged 87.2 hours per week, or 12.4 hours per day. Having never taken the time to work out my unbillable hours before, that answer surprised me. That's a *lot* of work.

So this Christmas I decided to do something I've never done before. On Christmas Eve I allowed my phone and tablet to run out of battery, and didn't charge them. I left the laptop at home. From 2PM on the 24th until 1PM on the 26th, I was completely uncontactable. I chatted with friends and family, ate good food, drank good wine. I even played charades. *It was brilliant*.

For that 48 hours, I was the most relaxed I think I've ever been, and I have no regrets whatsoever. In future when I take a day off, I'm going to do exactly the same thing. I'll say to my clients "I'm not working today", and spend my time doing all the things I never have enough time for when I'm working. So sorry, but I'm not sorry, and I now have a very different attitude to work on my personal time, that is:

**It can wait until tomorrow**.

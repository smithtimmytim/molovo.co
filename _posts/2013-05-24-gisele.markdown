<p class="center" style="color: #888"><em>A creative writing attempt.</em></p>

On Friday, it happened.

The first sense to be aroused was my hearing. The soft *click-click-click* of her ridiculous 6-inch heels, swaying her hips like a pirate-ship fairground ride as she - *whoops* - stumbles her way towards me.

Then my sight, taking in the soaked red dress, clinging to her body as though it were painted. The rain *drip-drip-dripping* from her oh-so-long blonde hair, hiding her face, turned to milk by the full moon.

Then, her slender shadow reaching me long before she did, I detected the warm fruity scent of over-sprayed perfume, advertising her desperation to find affection and warmth on this cold wet night.

Finally, touch, as she perched herself on my knees, and taste - gin - straight from the paper bag in her left hand to my mouth as her tongue and lips started exploring mine.

This was Gisele, and I had been waiting for this moment for 3 years.

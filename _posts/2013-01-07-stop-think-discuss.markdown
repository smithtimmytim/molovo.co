### An idea for reducing the number of arguments on social networks.

Everyone's done it. Someone posts something on Twitter that you wholeheartedly disagree with. So you reply and squeeze your distaste into 140 characters and end up offending said person. Then you find yourself faced with a deluge of abuse from the supporters of said person's argument, and back-pedal like crazy, maybe even writing an apologetic and unassertive blog post, completely abandoning your original ideas in the pursuit of a happier existence.

The answer? *Don't react*. The problem is, Twitter is an almost faceless communication platform. Chances are you don't really know this person. So rather than responding with your argument directly, try this:

1. Invite the offending person to have a skype or phone conversation with you to discuss the issue.
2. **Do not discuss the issue for the first five minutes**. This is important. Instead, spend 5 mins introducing yourselves, explaining your background, making small talk as though you'd just met in a bar.
3. Once you're at ease with each other's company, *then* agree to a well-constructed, considerate debate on the issue.
4. After a consensus has been agreed (even if it is to disagree), post your findings, either together or separately, so that others may gain a full-context insight into the discussion.

The benefits? Not only are you likely to make a good connection with a person, chances are, being face to face and unrestrained by character limits, you'll both learn a great deal from the other persons argument. Of course, there are still some people out there who are just generally unpleasant to deal with, if you run into that situation, just end the discussion and walk away. But for the most part, people are more than willing to have their horizons broadened and to hear opposing arguments. After all, why else would they post them onto a social network in the first place? Social networks are all about grabbing attention.

So, when we are all happily chatting away and there are no such things as internet fights, I hope you will all come back and thank me*.

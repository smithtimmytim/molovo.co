### How Facebook, Google+ and Twitter should make their money

Adverts annoy me. Adverts annoy the majority of people. There are entire industries devoted to blocking adverts on the web. Yet still, they persist in appearing on nearly every free website, social network and mobile app in existence. Why?

Facebook, Google+ and Twitter all employ promoted posts as their advertising method of choice. I, like half the world, use all of these social networks. I use them in both my personal life, as well as to promote my business. The people I follow on these networks are people whose posts I am interested in, who I know are going to write updates that I want to read. So when an advert appears in my stream, interrupting these posts, it annoys me. Even if it is a product I may be interested in, the first thing I look for is the hide button, because it is <em>unsolicited</em>. I have no problem with businesses that I follow promoting their content or services. This is because I have chosen to follow them, and by extension, the information that they post is information that I want to see.

Another thing that all three networks employ, is the “Report Spam” button. When I am sent a message that is unsolicited, that is, from a business/company/person who I am not following, I click the “Report Spam” button. Why do the social networks believe that people are going to be any more interested in “spam” just because the poster has paid them for the privilege of posting it. I know of many people who regularly use the “Report Spam” button on officially promoted posts for exactly this reason.

I appreciate that these networks need to make money. At the end of the day, why else do they exist? But they are all missing a completely obvious solution to these problems: why risk alienating the users on whom they rely, by spamming them with posts from businesses they have no interest in, when the obvious solution is to charge the millions of businesses that use their services every minute of every day?

Business accounts are already separate entities on Facebook and Google+, and it wouldn’t be a huge stretch to introduce the same on Twitter. All three encourage businesses to promote their posts in order to try and attract new customers. But a larger number of businesses rightly focus solely on their existing customers, the people who have already subscribed to their updates, and who wait with bated breath for the information they put out.

Given the large number of businesses, the charge wouldn’t need to be much for this strategy to work, say $10 a month. In fact, at this price, spread over all business accounts, they would probably make more money than they do currently. In a professional capacity, I mainly use Twitter. I have a modest 42 followers, and I follow 105 other people, most of whom are in the design and development industry. I would have no qualms about paying a small amount to continue using the service, because it provides a valuable insight into my industry, and allows me to promote my work to people who <em>I know are interested in it</em>. I’m sure there are many out there who feel the same way. You only need look at the success of app.net to see how this model works. For a business with tens or hundreds of thousands of followers, $10 a month is next to nothing.

All three networks would be able to keep accounts free for personal use, which is the lifeblood of the service, but by charging businesses <em>they wouldn’t need to keep spamming their users with unsolicited advertisements</em>.

This idea may well be controversial, so feel free to use the comments below to let me know your thoughts. Would you be happy to pay to use these services in a professional capacity?

The idea for The Branch came to me after writing an article on something that I'd seen when I first began my career as a web designer (which later became [the first article](http://thebran.ch/articles/what-if-money-was-no-object)).

After writing it, I realised that it would be great to know about the inspiration and motivation behind others in similiar industries. I've always enjoyed reading this kind of article, looking into the depths of a fellow creative mind, but had never seen one place with all these thoughts grouped together.

The Branch was launched with some great initial articles, and ever since then its fanbase has been growing, with excellent articles being written for the site by friends, colleagues and strangers alike.

I learnt a lot about how to run, support and advertise a website once launched, which wasn't something I'd had to do before, and love it when new articles arrive in my inbox out of the blue.

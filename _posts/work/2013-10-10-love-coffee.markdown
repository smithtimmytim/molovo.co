This was my first chance to work with the brilliant Chris Page at [Tait Design](http://taitdesign.co.uk). He came up with an awesome, eye-catching, colourful design which really shows of the great range of food and drink that Love Coffee have to offer.

I turned this into a responsive, easy-to-use site, which allows visitors all over the country to find and visit their nearest store, as well as providing news and updates, and allowing people to find and apply for employment opportunities with Love Coffee online.

The site has been a huge success, and as their first website, has been providing Love Coffee with some great exposure for their brand.

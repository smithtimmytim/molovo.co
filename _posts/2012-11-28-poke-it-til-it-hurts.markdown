### Combating "Brain Constipation"

I recently got a rather nasty case of what I have always referred to as "brain constipation". Others may call it designer's block, writer's block or lack of inspiration. Some have even associated it with anxiety or depression. All I know is, for one week, I was unable to produce a single piece of work I was happy with. I switched to trying to write a blog post instead; no more luck there. I was lost in a sea of frustration, scribbles and screwed up pieces of paper, with no escape in sight. In the end I did three things to overcome it.

#### Step one: Skrillex
This isn't going to be a pretentious post about how an artist's music changed my life. In fact, it's the opposite. You see, *I fucking hate Skrillex*. Word's cannot describe how appalling I find his "music", but I found a use for it nonetheless. On one particularly frustrating evening, I listened to Skrillex. On repeat. At full volume. I refused to stop listening, or working, until I had some tangible evidence of my ability on my screen.

#### Step two: Budweiser
I'm not a big drinker, mainly because I live miles from any real social scene and end up driving whenever I go out. But by midnight, I just felt like having a couple of beers. It may have helped, it may not, who knows.

#### Step three: Onword
I love [ Onword](http://onword.co). In fact, I'm using it to write this blog post. I always struggle with writing, and being able to hit F11 and have nothing but my own words to concentrate on makes it much easier for me. So, on this fateful evening, I fired up Onword and wrote out, in detail, a description of the logo I was trying to create; what I wanted to convey first and foremost, how that would be represented in the logo, what subtle additional contexts I would include, how it would fit in with the brand as a whole. In all I wrote 347 words, most of them rambling, but by the time I had finished, I had an almost pixel-perfect picture of the design I wanted in my head.

It was hard. It took until 5.30am. But I finished it. And the sense of euphoria I had after finally being happy with something threw me straight into my next project. I was back on form.

And the fruit of all this labour? Well it looks [kinda like this](http://dribbble.com/shots/827551-Facing-Africa).

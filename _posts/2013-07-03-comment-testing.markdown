I created this post as a live demo of [a new Anchor CMS plugin I'm working on](https://github.com/molovo/anchor-comments).

Each paragraph has a link to its left, which appears when you hover over the paragraph.

If a paragraph already has comments against it, the icon is always displayed, with the number of comments next to it.

Hover over the link, and a list of comments on that particular paragraph appears.

Click the plus icon to display the comment add form.

The comment is submitted via AJAX, and can be approved within the Anchor CMS admin console in the same way as the standard comments.

Please feel free to comment all over this article and test it out.

I might delete rude ones. It depends how witty you are really.

Update - you can now add quotes to your comments. Select any text (within the confines of one paragraph) on the page, and a tooltip appears. Click that, and the form appears with your quote in place. After the comment is submitted, the quote will appear above it in the list.

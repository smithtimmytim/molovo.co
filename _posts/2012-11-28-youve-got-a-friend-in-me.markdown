### Why I love my job

When I started molovo in 2009 it was little more than a hobby. I began making websites for a few of my friends, and then a few of their friends and so on. Things have been growing gradually, and finally, towards the end of August this year, I decided I was going to try and make it as a fully fledged designer and developer. I was terrified. Was it worth all the effort? What if I didn’t find any clients? Was I even good enough? How would I possibly manage to make a name for myself in this already overcrowded field?

I started actively using the services of Twitter and Loviv at around this time, as they gave me a good outlet to promote news and updates for molovo, as well as showing off some of my in-progress work. Since doing this, I have realised that my fears about joining the design and development community were trivial. I’ve realised that I don’t have any competitors in the traditional sense of the word. What I have instead is a worldwide community of friends, many of whom I’ve yet to meet, who are on hand to provide extremely useful design advice, help with code debugging, praise and criticism, and whose unending generosity has had a huge effect on both my confidence and ability.

I sincerely hope that one day I’ll be able to repay the kindness of these friends, acquaintances and strangers, as without their help I very much doubt I would have gotten off to the great start I’ve been lucky enough to enjoy. I'd particularly like to give a shout out to two extra-specially awesome people. [Sam Piggott](http://samdoesth.at) has provided some great free advice about getting started in the field, as well as some brilliant constructive criticism, and [Imran Parvez](http://twitter.com/imran_parvez), whose critique has helped me to eliminate bad habits and poor practises from my work.

I’ve also had the great fortune of being able to work with my little brother, best friend, and budding trainee Gareth, who has been a huge help in developing my wild and crazy ideas into useable concepts, testing new projects on a variety of different devices, and telling me honestly when I’m heading in the wrong direction.

It’s been a great couple of months, and I hope it continues. Overall though, if it’s made me realise one thing, it’s this:

*I wish I’d done it sooner*.

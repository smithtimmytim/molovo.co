Here's to the boring ones, the conformists, the sheep, the unimaginative, the round pegs in the round holes.

The ones who see everything the same. They blindly stick to the rules.

You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, or you can ignore them, because they change absolutely nothing.

They hold the human race back, and while some may see them as the sensible ones, we see asininity, because the ones who aren't crazy enough to think that they can change the world, go unnoticed as it passes them by.

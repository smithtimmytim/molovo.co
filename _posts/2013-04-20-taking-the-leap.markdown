Two weeks ago, I made a decision. After too long working in an organisation where I don't feel like I fit in, where change is fought at every corner, and where following processes is deemed more important than end results, I've decided to take a risk, hand in my notice, and become a freelancer full time.

I've been passionate about web design for a number of years, and have been taking on freelance work alongside the day job for the last year. I haven't made a huge amount of money, although I can match my current salary, but the feeling of worth I get from my clients, who appreciate and value the things I am able to do for them far outweighs any monetary reward I could ask for.

So, starting tomorrow, I'm giving up my job, giving up my house, moving back in with my folks, and hoping for the best. I've received a huge amount of support from people in all areas of the industry - friends, acquaintances and strangers alike - that makes me sure I'm making the right decision.

So here goes nothing. Wish me luck.

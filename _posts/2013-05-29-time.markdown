Today marks two days until the end of my love/hate relationship with full-time work, and I have to be honest, I'm fucked.

Excited as I was to be heading out into the world of freelancing, I've taken on more and more work to try and prepare myself for the jump. Since March I've been working on a 50-hour-per-week front-end development contract on top of the full time job. I've also been taking on around 12 hours per week in odd jobs for other clients, as well as general admin and working on my own projects.

You may have noticed that this doesn't leave much time for sleep or socialising. It doesn't. I usually get around one evening per week to get out and see friends or indulge my hobbies. I've been working an average of two all-nighters per week. Most days I'm walking around like a zombie and falling asleep at my desk.

Why am I telling you this? I'm telling you *not to be so fucking stupid*.

Manage your time. Manage it well. Don't take on more work than you can do.

Starting Monday I'll be limiting myself to 50 hours per week. **No more**. I need sleep, and I need a work/life balance.

Here's to a less sleepy future.
